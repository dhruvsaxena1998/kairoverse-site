> Hello World

Journalism as we all know is either centred on “polarising religious debate” or languishing in “seclusion”. How much we loathe to say it but there is ongoing “business of journalism”.

Business and journalism in their spirit must not be used synchronously but in contemporary times what we are seeing is blend of it with almost negligible proportion of the latter.

This business all depends on TRP, majoritarian ideology and corporate interest. The pluralist journalist standards have been kept alive by righteous few.

Whatever has been written till now reverberates cliché. But is harsh reality of capitalist time.

The brain behind “**The Philox**” is very simple as its origin word “**Philokalist**” which is someone who finds and appreciates beauty in all things.

India is the most diverse country in the world but when it comes to reporting “mainstream media” have handful of topics. Amidst the business, corporate and political interest the genuine issues concerning welfare of the citizens have been lost or left far behind.

This is the “great loophole” which prompted us to go with this initiative. Our pure motive is to report genuine community problems and issues plaguing inclusivity.

We are not driven by any political or corporate interest but by pluralistic journalism standards. Hate and propaganda heavily perpetuated by mainstream media has to break off.

It is another reality that majority viewers prefer news with taste of entertainment. We cannot shy of this actuality. On our platform we intend to create documentaries, reporting and propagating content in a manner which will keep our viewers glued to our platform. This is the novelty on the predicate of which our platform is based.

Our platform is also inspired by [“**Samdish Bhatia**”](https://www.instagram.com/samdishbhatia/ "Samdish Bhatia") who has successfully shown genuine issues without compromising with viewership. This includes reporting on Delhi riots, covid mis-management, reporting on grassroot level during elections etc.

On the similar track we intend to begin our voyage of journalism on newly constituted platform “**ThePhilox**”.

I would also like to thank team of [“**Kairoverse**”](https://kairoverse.com/ "Kairoverse") for providing us technical support and in building our website.
